The provided code implements a linear regression model to predict student marks based on two features: number of courses and time spent studying. Hereâ€™s a short description of what the code does:

Imports Necessary Libraries: Uses libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
Loads the Dataset: Reads a dataset named Student_Marks.csv that contains student data.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data by dropping rows with missing values.
Feature and Target Selection: Defines the features (number_courses and time_study) as x and the target variable (Marks) as y.
Splitting Data: The dataset is split into training and testing sets (75% training, 25% testing).
Model Training: A linear regression model is trained using the training data.
Predictions and Evaluation:
The model predicts the marks on the test set.
The performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Plots two graphs to show the relationship between:
Number of courses and predicted marks.
Time spent studying and predicted marks, along with the actual data and regression lines.
This model helps analyze how the number of courses and study time impact students' marks.
