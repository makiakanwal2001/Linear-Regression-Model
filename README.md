# Linear-Regression-Model
The code builds a linear regression model to predict student marks based on number of courses and study time. It splits the data into training and test sets, trains the model, and evaluates its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Finally, it visualizes the relationship between the features and marks with regression lines.
